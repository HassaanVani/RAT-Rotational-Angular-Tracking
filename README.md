# RAT — Rotational/Angular Tracking

> Automated behavioral scoring for lab mice using DeepLabCut's SuperAnimal models.

## Overview

RAT replaces hours of manual mouse tracking with automated behavioral classification. Using pre-trained SuperAnimal models from DeepLabCut, it tracks mouse keypoints (nose, ears, tail) and classifies behaviors like "Sniffing" vs. "Roaming" relative to stimulus zones.

## Key Features

- **No Training Required** — Uses pre-trained SuperAnimal-TopViewMouse model
- **4-Zone Behavior System** — Top Stimulus, Adjacent zones, Bottom Stimulus
- **Behavior Ethogram** — Sniffing, Grooming, Head orientation, Location tracking
- **Standalone Executable** — Windows installer for non-technical researchers
- **Batch Processing** — Analyze multiple videos in sequence

## Tech Stack

Python, DeepLabCut, PyInstaller, Tkinter
